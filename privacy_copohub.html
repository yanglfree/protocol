  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: August 6, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our GitHub client app ("the App"). We value your privacy and take your data protection seriously.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data from users. The App does not use any analytics SDKs, advertising networks, or third-party trackers.</p>

  <h2>2. GitHub Account Access</h2>
  <p>The App uses the official <strong>GitHub OAuth login</strong> to authenticate you directly with GitHub. Your GitHub access token is securely stored on your device and is never sent to any external server we control. We do not have access to your password or token.</p>

  <h2>3. How the App Uses GitHub API</h2>
  <p>The App connects directly to the official GitHub API to access your repositories, issues, pull requests, contribution data, and other public or authorized content. This is done solely to provide the features of the App and is not used for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>4. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data, including themes, settings, and widget preferences, is stored locally on your device. No data is transmitted to any third-party servers.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses only the <strong>official GitHub API</strong> (https://api.github.com). No other third-party services are integrated.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We follow best practices to ensure secure communication with GitHub via HTTPS. Your access token is stored securely using system-provided encryption mechanisms when possible.</p>

  <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy if necessary. Any changes will be published on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
